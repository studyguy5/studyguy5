- 👋 Hi, I’m @studyguy5
- 👀 I’m curious about systems, about UI, UX, how backend works, how db traffic happens and the list goes on
-  lol I centered a view divs since I started coding
- 🌱 I’m currently at mastering Javascript and start with OOP, go on with Typescript after that - will reach to a framework like Angular soon
- 💞️ I always open for a good teamwork, love to create code that makes your live easier, I have fun on develop visual concepts and reach valueable solutions for a better world with independend humans
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach me here on github for any questions - I'm trying to code every day - so maybe I see your messages
